## Build
For successfully running bot, you need to get 2 api keys:

1) `TELEGRAM_API_KEY` - key you can get from telegram [BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather)
2) `AUDD_IO_API_KEY` - music recognition api key from [audd.io](https://audd.io/)

These keys must be written in the file `src/constants.py` instead of placeholders

The build happens through [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/).
- `docker build -t donebd/tg_bot .` - for build image
- `docker run â€”name tg_bot donebd/tg_bot` - for run containter
